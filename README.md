# U-Net
U-Net Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation

I reproduced partly the results from the paper "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation". I focused only on the ISBI 2012 dataset, which was the only one I could get my hands on. And here I could not find the validation dataset, so I have no validation done. I could have separated the 30 images into training and validation dataset, but did not do so. The purpose of the reproduction of the results was more of an exercise in PyTorch.
